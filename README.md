- 👋 Hi, I’m @ra9m
- 👀 I’m interested in getting into Software Engineering! I'm currently a Chemistry major but my Research is in computation chemistry so my love for coding started there.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Python (for solving science problems, like solving equations, running simulations, etc.)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on scientific computational projects! If you're doing any simulations or anything math/physics/chemistry related, hit me up!
